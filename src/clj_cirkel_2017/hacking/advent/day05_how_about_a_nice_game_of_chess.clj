; --- Day 5: How About a Nice Game of Chess? ---
;
; You are faced with a security door designed by Easter Bunny engineers that seem to have acquired most of their
; security knowledge by watching hacking movies.
;
; The eight-character password for the door is generated one character at a time by finding the MD5 hash of some Door ID
; (your puzzle input) and an increasing integer index (starting with 0).
;
; A hash indicates the next character in the password if its hexadecimal representation starts with five zeroes. If it
; does, the sixth character in the hash is the next character of the password.
;
; For example, if the Door ID is abc:
;
; The first index which produces a hash that starts with five zeroes is 3231929, which we find by hashing abc3231929;
; the sixth character of the hash, and thus the first character of the password, is 1.

; 5017308 produces the next interesting hash, which starts with 000008f82..., so the second character of the password is
; 8.
;
; The third time a hash starts with five zeroes is for abc5278568, discovering the character f.
;
; In this example, after continuing this search a total of eight times, the password is 18f47a30.
;
; Given the actual Door ID, what is the password?
;
; Your puzzle input is ojvtpuvg.
;
; --- Part Two ---
;
; As the door slides open, you are presented with a second door that uses a slightly more inspired security mechanism.
; Clearly unimpressed by the last version (in what movie is the password decrypted in order?!), the Easter Bunny
; engineers have worked out a better solution.
;
; Instead of simply filling in the password from left to right, the hash now also indicates the position within the
; password to fill. You still look for hashes that begin with five zeroes; however, now, the sixth character represents
; the position (0-7), and the seventh character is the character to put in that position.
;
; A hash result of 000001f means that f is the second character in the password. Use only the first result for each
; position, and ignore invalid positions.
;
; For example, if the Door ID is abc:
;
; The first interesting hash is from abc3231929, which produces 0000015...; so, 5 goes in position 1: _5______.
;
; In the previous method, 5017308 produced an interesting hash; however, it is ignored, because it specifies an invalid
; position (8).
;
; The second interesting hash is at index 5357525, which produces 000004e...; so, e goes in position 4: _5__e___.
;
; You almost choke on your popcorn as the final character falls into place, producing the password 05ace8e3.
;
; Given the actual Door ID and this new method, what is the password? Be extra proud of your solution if it uses a
; cinematic "decrypting" animation.
;
; Your puzzle input is still ojvtpuvg.
