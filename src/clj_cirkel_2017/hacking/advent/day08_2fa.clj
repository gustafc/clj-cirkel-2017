; --- Day 8: Two-Factor Authentication ---
;
; You come across a door implementing what you can only assume is an implementation of two-factor authentication after a
; long game of requirements telephone.
;
; To get past the door, you first swipe a keycard (no problem; there was one on a nearby desk). Then, it displays a code
; on a little screen, and you type that code on a keypad. Then, presumably, the door unlocks.
;
; Unfortunately, the screen has been smashed. After a few minutes, you've taken everything apart and figured out how it
; works. Now you just have to work out what the screen would have displayed.
;
; The magnetic strip on the card you swiped encodes a series of instructions for the screen; these instructions are your
; puzzle input. The screen is 50 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall, all of which start off, and is capable of three somewhat
; peculiar operations:
;
;     rect AxB turns on all of the pixels in a rectangle at the top-left of the screen which is A wide and B tall.
;
;     rotate row y=A by B shifts all of the pixels in row A (0 is the top row) right by B pixels. Pixels that would fall
;     off the right end appear at the left end of the row.
;
;     rotate column x=A by B shifts all of the pixels in column A (0 is the left column) down by B pixels. Pixels that
;     would fall off the bottom appear at the top of the column.
;
; For example, here is a simple sequence on a smaller screen:
;
;     rect 3x2 creates a small rectangle in the top-left corner:
;
;     ###....
;     ###....
;     .......
;
;     rotate column x=1 by 1 rotates the second column down by one pixel:
;
;     #.#....
;     ###....
;     .#.....
;
;     rotate row y=0 by 4 rotates the top row right by four pixels:
;
;     ....#.#
;     ###....
;     .#.....
;
;     rotate column x=1 by 1 again rotates the second column down by one pixel, causing the bottom pixel to wrap back to
;     the top:
;
;     .#..#.#
;     #.#....
;     .#.....
;
; As you can see, this display technology is extremely powerful, and will soon dominate the tiny-code-displaying-screen
; market. That's what the advertisement on the back of the display tries to convince you, anyway.
;
; There seems to be an intermediate check of the voltage used by the display: after you swipe your card, if the screen
; did work, how many pixels should be lit?
