; --- Day 11: Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators ---
;
; You come upon a column of four floors that have been entirely sealed off from the rest of the building except for a
; small dedicated lobby. There are some radiation warnings and a big sign which reads "Radioisotope Testing Facility".
;
; According to the project status board, this facility is currently being used to experiment with Radioisotope
; Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs, or simply "generators") that are designed to be paired with specially-constructed
; microchips. Basically, an RTG is a highly radioactive rock that generates electricity through heat.
;
; The experimental RTGs have poor radiation containment, so they're dangerously radioactive. The chips are prototypes
; and don't have normal radiation shielding, but they do have the ability to generate an electromagnetic radiation
; shield when powered. Unfortunately, they can only be powered by their corresponding RTG. An RTG powering a microchip
; is still dangerous to other microchips.
;
; In other words, if a chip is ever left in the same area as another RTG, and it's not connected to its own RTG, the
; chip will be fried. Therefore, it is assumed that you will follow procedure and keep chips connected to their
; corresponding RTG when they're in the same room, and away from other RTGs otherwise.
;
; These microchips sound very interesting and useful to your current activities, and you'd like to try to retrieve them.
; The fourth floor of the facility has an assembling machine which can make a self-contained, shielded computer for you
; to take with you - that is, if you can bring it all of the RTGs and microchips.
;
; Within the radiation-shielded part of the facility (in which it's safe to have these pre-assembly RTGs), there is an
; elevator that can move between the four floors. Its capacity rating means it can carry at most yourself and two RTGs
; or microchips in any combination. (They're rigged to some heavy diagnostic equipment - the assembling machine will
; detach it for you.) As a security measure, the elevator will only function if it contains at least one RTG or
; microchip. The elevator always stops on each floor to recharge, and this takes long enough that the items within it
; and the items on that floor can irradiate each other. (You can prevent this if a Microchip and its Generator end up on
; the same floor in this way, as they can be connected while the elevator is recharging.)
;
; You make some notes of the locations of each component of interest (your puzzle input). Before you don a hazmat suit
; and start moving things around, you'd like to have an idea of what you need to do.
;
; When you enter the containment area, you and the elevator will start on the first floor.
;
; For example, suppose the isolated area has the following arrangement:
;
; The first floor contains a hydrogen-compatible microchip and a lithium-compatible microchip.
; The second floor contains a hydrogen generator.
; The third floor contains a lithium generator.
; The fourth floor contains nothing relevant.
;
; As a diagram (F# for a Floor number, E for Elevator, H for Hydrogen, L for Lithium, M for Microchip, and G for
; Generator), the initial state looks like this:
;
; F4 .  .  .  .  .
; F3 .  .  .  LG .
; F2 .  HG .  .  .
; F1 E  .  HM .  LM
;
; Then, to get everything up to the assembling machine on the fourth floor, the following steps could be taken:
;
;     Bring the Hydrogen-compatible Microchip to the second floor, which is safe because it can get power from the
;     Hydrogen Generator:
;
;     F4 .  .  .  .  .
;     F3 .  .  .  LG .
;     F2 E  HG HM .  .
;     F1 .  .  .  .  LM
;
;     Bring both Hydrogen-related items to the third floor, which is safe because the Hydrogen-compatible microchip is
;     getting power from its generator:
;
;     F4 .  .  .  .  .
;     F3 E  HG HM LG .
;     F2 .  .  .  .  .
;     F1 .  .  .  .  LM
;
;     Leave the Hydrogen Generator on floor three, but bring the Hydrogen-compatible Microchip back down with you so you
;     can still use the elevator:
;
;     F4 .  .  .  .  .
;     F3 .  HG .  LG .
;     F2 E  .  HM .  .
;     F1 .  .  .  .  LM
;
;     At the first floor, grab the Lithium-compatible Microchip, which is safe because Microchips don't affect each
;     other:
;
;     F4 .  .  .  .  .
;     F3 .  HG .  LG .
;     F2 .  .  .  .  .
;     F1 E  .  HM .  LM
;
;     Bring both Microchips up one floor, where there is nothing to fry them:
;
;     F4 .  .  .  .  .
;     F3 .  HG .  LG .
;     F2 E  .  HM .  LM
;     F1 .  .  .  .  .
;
;     Bring both Microchips up again to floor three, where they can be temporarily connected to their corresponding
;     generators while the elevator recharges, preventing either of them from being fried:
;
;     F4 .  .  .  .  .
;     F3 E  HG HM LG LM
;     F2 .  .  .  .  .
;     F1 .  .  .  .  .
;
;     Bring both Microchips to the fourth floor:
;
;     F4 E  .  HM .  LM
;     F3 .  HG .  LG .
;     F2 .  .  .  .  .
;     F1 .  .  .  .  .
;
;     Leave the Lithium-compatible microchip on the fourth floor, but bring the Hydrogen-compatible one so you can still
;     use the elevator; this is safe because although the Lithium Generator is on the destination floor, you can connect
;     Hydrogen-compatible microchip to the Hydrogen Generator there:
;
;     F4 .  .  .  .  LM
;     F3 E  HG HM LG .
;     F2 .  .  .  .  .
;     F1 .  .  .  .  .
;
;     Bring both Generators up to the fourth floor, which is safe because you can connect the Lithium-compatible
;     Microchip to the Lithium Generator upon arrival:
;
;     F4 E  HG .  LG LM
;     F3 .  .  HM .  .
;     F2 .  .  .  .  .
;     F1 .  .  .  .  .
;
;     Bring the Lithium Microchip with you to the third floor so you can use the elevator:
;
;     F4 .  HG .  LG .
;     F3 E  .  HM .  LM
;     F2 .  .  .  .  .
;     F1 .  .  .  .  .
;
;     Bring both Microchips to the fourth floor:
;
;     F4 E  HG HM LG LM
;     F3 .  .  .  .  .
;     F2 .  .  .  .  .
;     F1 .  .  .  .  .
;
; In this arrangement, it takes 11 steps to collect all of the objects at the fourth floor for assembly. (Each elevator
; stop counts as one step, even if nothing is added to or removed from it.)
;
; In your situation, what is the minimum number of steps required to bring all of the objects to the fourth floor?
