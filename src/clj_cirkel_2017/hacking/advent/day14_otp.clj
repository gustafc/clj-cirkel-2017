; --- Day 14: One-Time Pad ---
;
; In order to communicate securely with Santa while you're on this mission,
; you've been using a one-time pad that you generate using a pre-agreed
; algorithm. Unfortunately, you've run out of keys in your one-time pad, and so
; you need to generate some more.
;
; To generate keys, you first get a stream of random data by taking the MD5 of a
;  pre-arranged salt (your puzzle input) and an increasing integer index
; (starting with 0, and represented in decimal); the resulting MD5 hash should
; be represented as a string of lowercase hexadecimal digits.
;
; However, not all of these MD5 hashes are keys, and you need 64 new keys for
; your one-time pad. A hash is a key only if:
;
;     It contains three of the same character in a row, like 777. Only consider
;     the first such triplet in a hash.
;
;     One of the next 1000 hashes in the stream contains that same character
;     five times in a row, like 77777.
;
; Considering future hashes for five-of-a-kind sequences does not cause those
; hashes to be skipped; instead, regardless of whether the current hash is a
; key, always resume testing for keys starting with the very next hash.
;
; For example, if the pre-arranged salt is abc:
;
;     The first index which produces a triple is 18, because the MD5 hash of
;     abc18 contains ...cc38887a5.... However, index 18 does not count as a key
;     for your one-time pad, because none of the next thousand hashes (index 19
;     through index 1018) contain 88888.
;
;     The next index which produces a triple is 39; the hash of abc39 contains
;     eee. It is also the first key: one of the next thousand hashes (the one at
;     index 816) contains eeeee.
;
;     None of the next six triples are keys, but the one after that, at index
;     92, is: it contains 999 and index 200 contains 99999.
;
;     Eventually, index 22728 meets all of the criteria to generate the 64th key.
;
; So, using our example salt of abc, index 22728 produces the 64th key.
;
; Given the actual salt in your puzzle input, what index produces your 64th
; one-time pad key?
;
; Your puzzle input is yjdafjpo.
;
; --- Part Two ---
;
; Of course, in order to make this process even more secure, you've also implemented key stretching.
;
; Key stretching forces attackers to spend more time generating hashes. Unfortunately, it forces everyone else to spend
; more time, too.
;
; To implement key stretching, whenever you generate a hash, before you use it, you first find the MD5 hash of that
; hash, then the MD5 hash of that hash, and so on, a total of 2016 additional hashings. Always use lowercase hexadecimal
; representations of hashes.
;
; For example, to find the stretched hash for index 0 and salt abc:
;
;     Find the MD5 hash of abc0: 577571be4de9dcce85a041ba0410f29f.
;     Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash: eec80a0c92dc8a0777c619d9bb51e910.
;     Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash: 16062ce768787384c81fe17a7a60c7e3.
;     ...repeat many times...
;     Then, find the MD5 hash of that hash: a107ff634856bb300138cac6568c0f24.
;
; So, the stretched hash for index 0 in this situation is a107ff.... In the end, you find the original hash (one use of
; MD5), then find the hash-of-the-previous-hash 2016 times, for a total of 2017 uses of MD5.
;
; The rest of the process remains the same, but now the keys are entirely different. Again for salt abc:
;
;     The first triple (222, at index 5) has no matching 22222 in the next thousand hashes.
;     The second triple (eee, at index 10) hash a matching eeeee at index 89, and so it is the first key.
;     Eventually, index 22551 produces the 64th key (triple fff with matching fffff at index 22859.
;
; Given the actual salt in your puzzle input and using 2016 extra MD5 calls of key stretching, what index now produces
; your 64th one-time pad key?
;
; Your puzzle input is still yjdafjpo.
