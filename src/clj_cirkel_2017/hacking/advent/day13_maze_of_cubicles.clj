; --- Day 13: A Maze of Twisty Little Cubicles ---
;
; You arrive at the first floor of this new building to discover a much less welcoming environment than the shiny atrium
; of the last one. Instead, you are in a maze of twisty little cubicles, all alike.
;
; Every location in this area is addressed by a pair of non-negative integers (x,y). Each such coordinate is either a
; wall or an open space. You can't move diagonally. The cube maze starts at 0,0 and seems to extend infinitely toward
; positive x and y; negative values are invalid, as they represent a location outside the building. You are in a small
; waiting area at 1,1.
;
; While it seems chaotic, a nearby morale-boosting poster explains, the layout is actually quite logical. You can
; determine whether a given x,y coordinate will be a wall or an open space using a simple system:
;
;     Find x*x + 3*x + 2*x*y + y + y*y.
;     Add the office designer's favorite number (your puzzle input).
;     Find the binary representation of that sum; count the number of bits that are 1.
;         If the number of bits that are 1 is even, it's an open space.
;         If the number of bits that are 1 is odd, it's a wall.
;
; For example, if the office designer's favorite number were 10, drawing walls as # and open spaces as ., the corner of
; the building containing 0,0 would look like this:
;
;   0123456789
; 0 .#.####.##
; 1 ..#..#...#
; 2 #....##...
; 3 ###.#.###.
; 4 .##..#..#.
; 5 ..##....#.
; 6 #...##.###
;
; Now, suppose you wanted to reach 7,4. The shortest route you could take is marked as O:
;
;   0123456789
; 0 .#.####.##
; 1 .O#..#...#
; 2 #OOO.##...
; 3 ###O#.###.
; 4 .##OO#OO#.
; 5 ..##OOO.#.
; 6 #...##.###
;
; Thus, reaching 7,4 would take a minimum of 11 steps (starting from your current location, 1,1).
;
; What is the fewest number of steps required for you to reach 31,39?
;
; Your puzzle input is 1364.
;
; --- Part Two ---
;
; How many locations (distinct x,y coordinates, including your starting location) can you reach in at most 50 steps?
