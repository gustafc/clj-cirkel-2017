; --- Day 6: Signals and Noise ---
;
; Something is jamming your communications with Santa. Fortunately, your signal is only partially jammed, and protocol
; in situations like this is to switch to a simple repetition code to get the message through.
;
; In this model, the same message is sent repeatedly. You've recorded the repeating message signal (your puzzle input),
; but the data seems quite corrupted - almost too badly to recover. Almost.
;
; All you need to do is figure out which character is most frequent for each position. For example, suppose you had
; recorded the following messages:
;
; eedadn
; drvtee
; eandsr
; raavrd
; atevrs
; tsrnev
; sdttsa
; rasrtv
; nssdts
; ntnada
; svetve
; tesnvt
; vntsnd
; vrdear
; dvrsen
; enarar
;
; The most common character in the first column is e; in the second, a; in the third, s, and so on. Combining these
; characters returns the error-corrected message, easter.
;
; Given the recording in your puzzle input, what is the error-corrected version of the message being sent?
;
; --- Part Two ---
;
; Of course, that would be the message - if you hadn't agreed to use a modified repetition code instead.
;
; In this modified code, the sender instead transmits what looks like random data, but for each character, the character
; they actually want to send is slightly less likely than the others. Even after signal-jamming noise, you can look at
; the letter distributions in each column and choose the least common letter to reconstruct the original message.
;
; In the above example, the least common character in the first column is a; in the second, d, and so on. Repeating this
; process for the remaining characters produces the original message, advent.
;
; Given the recording in your puzzle input and this new decoding methodology, what is the original message that Santa is
; trying to send?
