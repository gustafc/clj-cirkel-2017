; --- Day 7: Internet Protocol Version 7 ---
;
; While snooping around the local network of EBHQ, you compile a list of IP addresses (they're IPv7, of course; IPv6 is
; much too limited). You'd like to figure out which IPs support TLS (transport-layer snooping).
;
; An IP supports TLS if it has an Autonomous Bridge Bypass Annotation, or ABBA. An ABBA is any four-character sequence
; which consists of a pair of two different characters followed by the reverse of that pair, such as xyyx or abba.
; However, the IP also must not have an ABBA within any hypernet sequences, which are contained by square brackets.
;
; For example:
;
;     abba[mnop]qrst supports TLS (abba outside square brackets).
;     abcd[bddb]xyyx does not support TLS (bddb is within square brackets, even though xyyx is outside square brackets).
;     aaaa[qwer]tyui does not support TLS (aaaa is invalid; the interior characters must be different).
;     ioxxoj[asdfgh]zxcvbn supports TLS (oxxo is outside square brackets, even though it's within a larger string).
;
; How many IPs in your puzzle input support TLS?
;
; --- Part Two ---
;
; You would also like to know which IPs support SSL (super-secret listening).
;
; An IP supports SSL if it has an Area-Broadcast Accessor, or ABA, anywhere in the supernet sequences (outside any
; square bracketed sections), and a corresponding Byte Allocation Block, or BAB, anywhere in the hypernet sequences. An
; ABA is any three-character sequence which consists of the same character twice with a different character between
; them, such as xyx or aba. A corresponding BAB is the same characters but in reversed positions: yxy and bab,
; respectively.
;
; For example:
;
;     aba[bab]xyz supports SSL (aba outside square brackets with corresponding bab within square brackets).
;
;     xyx[xyx]xyx does not support SSL (xyx, but no corresponding yxy).
;
;     aaa[kek]eke supports SSL (eke in supernet with corresponding kek in hypernet; the aaa sequence is not related,
;     because the interior character must be different).
;
;     zazbz[bzb]cdb supports SSL (zaz has no corresponding aza, but zbz has a corresponding bzb, even though zaz and zbz
;     overlap).
;
; How many IPs in your puzzle input support SSL?
